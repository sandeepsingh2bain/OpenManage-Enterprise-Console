# Task: Foundation & Components - Reusable UI Component Library

## Description

Build the core reusable UI component library that all pages will depend on. This includes StatsCard, DataTable, StatusBadge, ProgressBar, ChartContainer, SearchBar, ExportButton, and RefreshIndicator components. These components form the foundation of the application's user interface and must be built with accessibility, TypeScript strict typing, and Tailwind CSS styling.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] StatsCard component with metric display, trend indicator, and loading state
- [ ] DataTable component with sorting, pagination, and customizable columns
- [ ] StatusBadge component with color-coded states (Healthy, Warning, Critical, Offline)
- [ ] ProgressBar component with percentage display and animated transitions
- [ ] ChartContainer component as wrapper for Recharts with consistent styling
- [ ] SearchBar component with real-time filtering and debouncing
- [ ] ExportButton component with CSV download functionality
- [ ] RefreshIndicator component with auto-refresh timer and manual button
- [ ] All components have TypeScript interfaces for props
- [ ] All components include ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support
- [ ] All components pass 4.5:1 color contrast ratio for WCAG 2.1 AA

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach:**
- Create components in `ome-dashboard/src/components/ui/` directory
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with existing design tokens
- Implement TypeScript interfaces in component files
- Use Lucide React for consistent iconography
- Follow atomic design principles for composability

**Key Considerations:**
- Ensure components are fully accessible with proper ARIA attributes
- Implement loading and error states for all interactive components
- Add prop validation with TypeScript for type safety
- Use React.memo for performance optimization where appropriate
- Create consistent spacing and sizing using Tailwind utilities

**Code Locations:**
- `ome-dashboard/src/components/ui/StatsCard.tsx`
- `ome-dashboard/src/components/ui/DataTable.tsx`
- `ome-dashboard/src/components/ui/StatusBadge.tsx`
- `ome-dashboard/src/components/ui/ProgressBar.tsx`
- `ome-dashboard/src/components/ui/ChartContainer.tsx`
- `ome-dashboard/src/components/ui/SearchBar.tsx`
- `ome-dashboard/src/components/ui/ExportButton.tsx`
- `ome-dashboard/src/components/ui/RefreshIndicator.tsx`

## Dependencies

- [ ] Tailwind CSS configuration with Dell EMC brand colors
- [ ] Lucide React icon library
- [ ] TypeScript strict mode configuration
- [ ] Recharts library for chart components

## Effort Estimate

- **Size:** M (Medium)
- **Hours:** 12-16 hours (1.5-2 days)
- **Parallel:** true (can run independently)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All 8 components implemented and exported
- [ ] TypeScript interfaces defined for all component props
- [ ] Components render correctly with sample data
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met (ARIA labels, keyboard nav, contrast)
- [ ] Components documented with JSDoc comments
- [ ] No TypeScript errors or ESLint warnings
- [ ] Components tested manually in isolation
