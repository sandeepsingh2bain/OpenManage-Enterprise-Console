# Task: Alert Management - List with Acknowledge and Auto-Refresh

## Description

Create the Alert Management page with summary cards showing alert counts by severity (Critical, Warning, Info), a detailed alert list with acknowledgment actions, and configurable auto-refresh every 30 seconds. This page helps NOC operators and administrators respond to system alerts quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Three summary cards display: Critical Alerts, Warning Alerts, Info Alerts counts
- [ ] Alert list displays: Severity badge, device name, category, message, recommended action, timestamp
- [ ] Relative timestamp display (e.g., "2 hours ago") using date-fns
- [ ] Acknowledge button for unacknowledged alerts
- [ ] Optimistic UI update when acknowledging alerts
- [ ] Auto-refresh every 30 seconds (configurable in settings)
- [ ] Alert categories: System Health, Storage, Updates, Network, Configuration
- [ ] Color-coded severity badges (Critical: red, Warning: orange, Info: blue)
- [ ] Single-click acknowledge action with immediate visual feedback
- [ ] Loading and error states handled

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach:**
- Create `ome-dashboard/src/pages/Alerts.tsx` page component
- Use StatsCard component from Task 2 for summary cards
- Use DataTable and StatusBadge components for alert list
- Create custom React Query hook: `useAlerts()` with 30s refetch interval
- Implement alert acknowledgment with mutation and optimistic updates
- Use date-fns for relative timestamp formatting

**Key Considerations:**
- Implement optimistic updates for instant feedback on acknowledge
- Handle acknowledgment failures with rollback
- Group alerts by severity for summary cards
- Sort alerts by timestamp (most recent first)
- Add visual indicator for acknowledged vs unacknowledged alerts
- Ensure auto-refresh doesn't cause UI flicker

**Code Locations:**
- `ome-dashboard/src/pages/Alerts.tsx`
- `ome-dashboard/src/hooks/useAlerts.ts` (custom hook)
- `ome-dashboard/src/hooks/useAcknowledgeAlert.ts` (mutation hook)

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 2: StatsCard, DataTable, StatusBadge, RefreshIndicator components
- [ ] Task 6: Mock API with alert data and acknowledge endpoint
- [ ] React Query for data fetching and mutations
- [ ] date-fns for timestamp formatting (already installed)

## Effort Estimate

- **Size:** L (Large)
- **Hours:** 16-20 hours (2-3 days)
- **Parallel:** false (depends on Tasks 2 & 6)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Alerts page implemented and routing configured
- [ ] Summary cards display correct alert counts
- [ ] Alert list displays all required information
- [ ] Acknowledge button works with optimistic updates
- [ ] Auto-refresh works every 30 seconds without flicker
- [ ] Relative timestamps update correctly
- [ ] Loading and error states handled
- [ ] Acknowledged alerts are visually distinct
- [ ] No TypeScript errors or ESLint warnings
- [ ] Page is responsive on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [ ] Alert acknowledgment provides immediate feedback (<100ms)
