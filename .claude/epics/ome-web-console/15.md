# Task: Theme & Layout - Dark/Light Mode and Responsive Design

## Description

Complete the dark/light mode implementation using ThemeContext and refine the responsive layout for mobile, tablet, and desktop. Ensure theme toggle applies instantly without page reload, theme preference persists in LocalStorage, and all pages/components adapt correctly to both themes and all screen sizes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dark/light mode toggle button in header/sidebar
- [ ] Theme toggle applies instantly without page reload
- [ ] Theme preference persists in LocalStorage
- [ ] All components render correctly in both dark and light modes
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG 2.1 AA (4.5:1) in both themes
- [ ] Responsive layout works on 640px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px+ (desktop)
- [ ] Sidebar collapses on mobile and tablet
- [ ] Navigation menu is accessible on all screen sizes
- [ ] Charts and tables adapt to smaller screens
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling on mobile devices
- [ ] Touch targets are minimum 44x44px on mobile

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach:**
- Extend existing `ome-dashboard/src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx`
- Update `ome-dashboard/src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx` with theme toggle
- Configure Tailwind CSS dark mode with 'class' strategy
- Add theme-aware color tokens to Tailwind config
- Implement LocalStorage persistence for theme preference
- Test all pages on multiple screen sizes

**Key Considerations:**
- Use Tailwind's dark mode utilities (dark:bg-gray-900, etc.)
- Ensure all color combinations meet accessibility standards
- Add smooth transitions for theme changes (200ms)
- Handle system theme preference detection (future enhancement)
- Test with browser zoom levels (100%, 125%, 150%)
- Ensure focus indicators visible in both themes

**Code Locations:**
- `ome-dashboard/src/contexts/ThemeContext.tsx` (extend existing)
- `ome-dashboard/src/components/DashboardLayout.tsx` (extend existing)
- `ome-dashboard/tailwind.config.js` (update theme colors)

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 2: UI components that need theme support
- [ ] Tailwind CSS configuration
- [ ] ThemeContext (already exists, needs extension)
- [ ] LocalStorage browser API

## Effort Estimate

- **Size:** S (Small)
- **Hours:** 6-8 hours (1 day)
- **Parallel:** true (can work alongside feature pages)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Theme toggle button implemented and functional
- [ ] Dark mode colors defined in Tailwind config
- [ ] All pages render correctly in both themes
- [ ] Theme preference persists in LocalStorage
- [ ] Color contrast verified for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- [ ] Responsive layouts tested on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [ ] Sidebar collapse works correctly on small screens
- [ ] No TypeScript errors or ESLint warnings
- [ ] Theme toggle is keyboard accessible
- [ ] No layout shift or flicker during theme change
