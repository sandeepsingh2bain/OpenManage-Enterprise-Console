# Task: Device Inventory - Table with Search, Filter, and Export

## Description

Implement the Device Inventory page with a sortable, filterable table displaying all devices. Include real-time search by device name, service tag, and model; status filtering (All, Healthy, Warning, Critical, Offline); and CSV export functionality. This page allows administrators to view and manage their infrastructure inventory.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Device list table displays: Device Name, Service Tag, Model, Type, IP Address, Status
- [ ] Table columns are sortable (click column header to sort)
- [ ] Real-time search filters by device name, service tag, and model
- [ ] Status filter dropdown (All, Healthy, Warning, Critical, Offline)
- [ ] Combined filter logic (search AND status)
- [ ] Case-insensitive matching for search
- [ ] Export to CSV button generates file with filtered data
- [ ] CSV filename format: `ome-devices-{timestamp}.csv`
- [ ] Search returns results with <100ms perceived latency
- [ ] Table displays loading state during data fetch
- [ ] Empty state when no devices match filters

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach:**
- Create `ome-dashboard/src/pages/Devices.tsx` page component
- Use DataTable component from Task 2 for device list
- Use SearchBar and ExportButton components from Task 2
- Create custom React Query hook: `useDevices()` with filtering support
- Implement client-side filtering with useMemo for performance
- Use browser download API for CSV export

**Key Considerations:**
- Debounce search input (300ms) to reduce re-renders
- Store filter state in component state (not URL for Phase 1)
- Generate CSV with proper escaping for special characters
- Use React.memo for table rows to optimize rendering
- Implement virtual scrolling if device count > 1000 (future optimization)

**Code Locations:**
- `ome-dashboard/src/pages/Devices.tsx`
- `ome-dashboard/src/hooks/useDevices.ts` (custom hook)
- `ome-dashboard/src/lib/csvExport.ts` (utility functions)

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 2: DataTable, SearchBar, ExportButton, StatusBadge components
- [ ] Task 6: Mock API with device data
- [ ] React Query for data fetching
- [ ] clsx for conditional styling (already installed)

## Effort Estimate

- **Size:** L (Large)
- **Hours:** 16-20 hours (2-3 days)
- **Parallel:** false (depends on Tasks 2 & 6)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Devices page implemented and routing configured
- [ ] Device table displays all required columns
- [ ] Sorting works on all columns
- [ ] Real-time search filters devices correctly
- [ ] Status filter dropdown works with combined logic
- [ ] CSV export generates correct file with filtered data
- [ ] Search has <100ms perceived latency
- [ ] Loading and empty states handled
- [ ] No TypeScript errors or ESLint warnings
- [ ] Page is responsive on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [ ] Table handles 1000+ devices without performance degradation
