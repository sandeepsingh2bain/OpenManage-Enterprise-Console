# Task: Reports Interface - Generation and Export UI

## Description

Add the Reports page with UI for generating and exporting all 6 report types: Device Inventory, Alert History, Compliance, Job Execution History, Warranty, and Health Trend reports. Provide report descriptions, parameter selection, and CSV download functionality to support compliance and management reporting needs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Reports page displays all 6 report types with descriptions
- [ ] Report cards: Device Inventory, Alert History, Compliance, Job Execution History, Warranty, Health Trend
- [ ] "Generate Report" button for each report type
- [ ] Report generation shows loading state
- [ ] CSV download initiates automatically after generation
- [ ] Filename format: `ome-{report-type}-{timestamp}.csv`
- [ ] Report generation completes within 5 seconds for typical datasets
- [ ] Error handling for failed report generation
- [ ] Success message after download initiation
- [ ] Report export works with 1000+ rows without browser hang

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach:**
- Create `ome-dashboard/src/pages/Reports.tsx` page component
- Use ExportButton component from Task 2
- Create custom React Query hook: `useReports()` for report data
- Implement report generation as async operations with loading states
- Use browser download API for CSV export
- Generate CSV with proper formatting and headers

**Key Considerations:**
- Report data comes from mock API (Task 6)
- Use React Query mutations for report generation
- Implement chunked CSV generation for large datasets
- Add download progress indicator for large reports
- Handle browser memory limits for very large exports
- Provide report preview before download (future enhancement)

**Code Locations:**
- `ome-dashboard/src/pages/Reports.tsx`
- `ome-dashboard/src/hooks/useReports.ts` (custom hook)
- `ome-dashboard/src/lib/reportGenerator.ts` (utility functions)

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 2: ExportButton component
- [ ] Task 6: Mock API with report data generators
- [ ] React Query for report generation mutations
- [ ] CSV export utilities

## Effort Estimate

- **Size:** M (Medium)
- **Hours:** 10-14 hours (1.5-2 days)
- **Parallel:** false (depends on Tasks 2 & 6)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Reports page implemented and routing configured
- [ ] All 6 report types displayed with descriptions
- [ ] Report generation button triggers CSV download
- [ ] Loading states show during generation
- [ ] CSV files download with correct format and filename
- [ ] Error states handled gracefully
- [ ] Large reports (1000+ rows) generate without browser hang
- [ ] No TypeScript errors or ESLint warnings
- [ ] Page is responsive on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [ ] Reports meet <5 click requirement for generation
