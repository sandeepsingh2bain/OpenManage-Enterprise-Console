# Task: Accessibility & Testing - WCAG Compliance and Cross-Browser Validation

## Description

Conduct comprehensive accessibility audit to ensure WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance, perform cross-browser testing on Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, and Edge 90+, and execute user acceptance testing with the three personas (Alex, Sam, Jordan). Verify all acceptance criteria from the PRD are met and document any issues or improvements.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance verified with automated tools (axe DevTools)
- [ ] Color contrast ratios 4.5:1 minimum for all text
- [ ] All interactive elements have visible focus indicators
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works for all features (no mouse required)
- [ ] ARIA labels and roles properly applied to all components
- [ ] Screen reader testing completed (VoiceOver on macOS)
- [ ] Cross-browser testing on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- [ ] Responsive testing on mobile (640px), tablet (768px), desktop (1024px+)
- [ ] User acceptance testing scenarios completed for all three personas
- [ ] All PRD acceptance criteria verified and documented

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach:**
- Run axe DevTools extension on all pages
- Test with keyboard-only navigation (Tab, Enter, Space, Arrow keys)
- Verify ARIA labels with browser inspector
- Test with VoiceOver screen reader on macOS or NVDA on Windows
- Use BrowserStack or similar for cross-browser testing
- Create UAT test scenarios for Alex, Sam, and Jordan personas
- Document all findings in issue tracker

**Key Considerations:**
- Focus on critical user paths (login → dashboard, acknowledge alert, export CSV)
- Test auto-refresh behavior with screen readers
- Verify form inputs have proper labels
- Ensure error messages are accessible
- Test with browser zoom levels (100%, 125%, 150%, 200%)
- Validate keyboard shortcuts don't conflict with browser/screen reader

**Testing Scenarios:**
- **Alex (Senior SysAdmin):** View metrics in <5s, navigate to device in <30s, export report in <5 clicks
- **Sam (NOC Operator):** Acknowledge alert with single click, monitor real-time job updates
- **Jordan (IT Manager):** Export device inventory, review historical trends

**Code Locations:**
- All pages and components (audit coverage)
- Documentation in `.claude/epics/ome-web-console/testing-report.md`

## Dependencies

- [ ] Tasks 9-15: All feature pages and theme implementation
- [ ] axe DevTools or similar accessibility tool
- [ ] Cross-browser testing environment (BrowserStack or local browsers)
- [ ] Screen reader software (VoiceOver, NVDA, or JAWS)

## Effort Estimate

- **Size:** L (Large)
- **Hours:** 16-20 hours (2-3 days)
- **Parallel:** false (requires completed features)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Accessibility audit completed with zero critical issues
- [ ] All WCAG 2.1 AA requirements verified
- [ ] Keyboard navigation tested on all pages
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility verified
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed (4 browsers)
- [ ] Responsive design tested (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- [ ] UAT scenarios completed for all three personas
- [ ] All PRD acceptance criteria met and documented
- [ ] Testing report created with findings and resolutions
- [ ] Any remaining issues documented in backlog
- [ ] Sign-off from product owner (or equivalent)
