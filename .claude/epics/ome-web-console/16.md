# Task: Performance Optimization - Code Splitting and Caching

## Description

Implement performance optimizations including route-based code splitting with React lazy loading, React.memo for expensive components, React Query caching strategies, and bundle size optimization. Conduct Lighthouse audits and ensure the application meets performance targets: <2s initial load, <3s time to interactive, <500ms subsequent navigation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Route-based code splitting implemented with React.lazy and Suspense
- [ ] React.memo applied to expensive components (DataTable, ChartContainer)
- [ ] React Query configured with optimal cache times (30s stale time)
- [ ] Vite build produces optimized bundles with tree-shaking
- [ ] Initial bundle size < 500KB gzipped
- [ ] Lazy loading implemented for Recharts (only loaded when needed)
- [ ] Image optimization for any static assets
- [ ] Lighthouse performance score 90+ (mobile and desktop)
- [ ] Initial page load < 2 seconds (95th percentile)
- [ ] Time to interactive < 3 seconds
- [ ] Subsequent navigation < 500ms

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach:**
- Wrap route components with React.lazy() in router configuration
- Add Suspense boundaries with loading fallbacks
- Apply React.memo to DataTable, StatsCard, ChartContainer components
- Configure React Query with staleTime, cacheTime, refetchOnWindowFocus
- Use Vite's code splitting and chunk optimization
- Run Lighthouse CI in build pipeline
- Profile with React DevTools and Chrome DevTools

**Key Considerations:**
- Use skeleton screens for lazy-loaded components
- Preload critical routes for faster navigation
- Implement virtualization for large lists (future if needed)
- Minimize re-renders with useMemo and useCallback
- Ensure auto-refresh doesn't trigger unnecessary re-renders
- Monitor bundle sizes with vite-plugin-compression

**Code Locations:**
- `ome-dashboard/src/main.tsx` (router with lazy loading)
- `ome-dashboard/src/components/ui/*.tsx` (add React.memo)
- `ome-dashboard/vite.config.ts` (build optimization)
- `ome-dashboard/src/lib/queryClient.ts` (React Query config)

## Dependencies

- [ ] Tasks 9-14: All feature pages implemented
- [ ] Vite build configuration
- [ ] React Query configured
- [ ] Lighthouse CI or similar performance tool

## Effort Estimate

- **Size:** L (Large)
- **Hours:** 16-20 hours (2-3 days)
- **Parallel:** false (requires completed features)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code splitting implemented for all routes
- [ ] React.memo applied to performance-critical components
- [ ] React Query caching optimized
- [ ] Vite build configuration optimized
- [ ] Lighthouse audit shows 90+ performance score
- [ ] Initial page load meets <2s target
- [ ] Time to interactive meets <3s target
- [ ] Subsequent navigation meets <500ms target
- [ ] Bundle size < 500KB gzipped verified
- [ ] No TypeScript errors or ESLint warnings
- [ ] Performance metrics documented
