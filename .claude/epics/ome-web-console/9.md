# Task: Dashboard Page - Overview with Stats and Charts

## Description

Build the Dashboard page (home page) with overview statistics cards, server health distribution pie chart, and recent alerts list. Implement auto-refresh every 30 seconds using React Query and integrate with the mock API layer. This is the primary landing page users see after login.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Four stats cards display: Total Servers, Critical Alerts, Running Jobs, Health Status
- [ ] Each stats card shows metric value, trend indicator, and percentage
- [ ] Server health distribution pie chart using Recharts (Healthy, Warning, Critical, Offline)
- [ ] Chart includes interactive tooltips and legend display
- [ ] Recent alerts section displays 5 most recent alerts with severity badges
- [ ] "View All Alerts" button navigates to Alerts page
- [ ] Auto-refresh every 30 seconds using React Query refetchInterval
- [ ] Loading states for initial data fetch
- [ ] Error boundaries handle API failures gracefully
- [ ] Dashboard loads within 5 seconds (per PRD requirement)

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach:**
- Create `ome-dashboard/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx` page component
- Use StatsCard component from Task 2 for metrics display
- Integrate ChartContainer and Recharts for pie chart visualization
- Create custom React Query hooks: `useDashboardStats()`, `useRecentAlerts()`
- Configure 30-second auto-refresh with React Query's `refetchInterval`
- Use React Router for "View All Alerts" navigation

**Key Considerations:**
- Aggregate statistics from device, alert, and job data
- Calculate health percentages for pie chart
- Format timestamps for recent alerts using date-fns
- Implement optimistic loading with skeleton screens
- Ensure chart is responsive and accessible

**Code Locations:**
- `ome-dashboard/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`
- `ome-dashboard/src/hooks/useDashboardStats.ts` (custom hook)
- `ome-dashboard/src/hooks/useRecentAlerts.ts` (custom hook)

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 2: StatsCard, ChartContainer, StatusBadge components
- [ ] Task 6: Mock API with devices, alerts, jobs data
- [ ] React Query configured with 30s refetch interval
- [ ] Recharts library for pie chart

## Effort Estimate

- **Size:** L (Large)
- **Hours:** 16-20 hours (2-3 days)
- **Parallel:** false (depends on Tasks 2 & 6)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Dashboard page implemented and routing configured
- [ ] All four stats cards display correct data
- [ ] Pie chart renders with correct data and styling
- [ ] Recent alerts list displays with severity badges
- [ ] Auto-refresh works without UI flicker
- [ ] Loading and error states handled
- [ ] Navigation to Alerts page functional
- [ ] Dashboard meets <5s load time requirement
- [ ] No TypeScript errors or ESLint warnings
- [ ] Page is responsive on mobile, tablet, desktop
