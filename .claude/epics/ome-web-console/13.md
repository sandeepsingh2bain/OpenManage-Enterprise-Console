# Task: Job Monitoring - Real-Time Updates with Progress Bars

## Description

Develop the Job Monitoring page with summary cards for job counts (Running, Completed, Failed), a job list with real-time status updates every 10 seconds, progress bars for running jobs, and animated pulse indicators for active jobs. This page enables tracking of ongoing maintenance operations like firmware updates and inventory scans.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Three summary cards display: Running Jobs, Completed Jobs, Failed Jobs counts
- [ ] Job list displays: Job name, type, status badge, start time, end time/progress
- [ ] Progress bar for running jobs with percentage (0-100%)
- [ ] Animated pulse effect on running job status badges
- [ ] "In Progress" label for running jobs (no end time)
- [ ] Auto-refresh every 10 seconds using React Query
- [ ] Job types supported: Discovery, Inventory, Firmware Update, Configuration Backup, Report Generation
- [ ] Color-coded status badges (Running: blue, Completed: green, Failed: red)
- [ ] Job status updates visible within 10 seconds of state change
- [ ] Loading and error states handled

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach:**
- Create `ome-dashboard/src/pages/Jobs.tsx` page component
- Use StatsCard and ProgressBar components from Task 2
- Use DataTable and StatusBadge for job list
- Create custom React Query hook: `useJobs()` with 10s refetch interval
- Implement CSS animations for pulse effect on running jobs
- Format timestamps with date-fns

**Key Considerations:**
- Use shorter refetch interval (10s) for more frequent updates
- Implement smooth progress bar transitions (CSS animations)
- Add visual distinction for running vs completed jobs
- Group jobs by status for summary cards
- Handle job state transitions gracefully (running → completed)
- Ensure auto-refresh doesn't reset scroll position

**Code Locations:**
- `ome-dashboard/src/pages/Jobs.tsx`
- `ome-dashboard/src/hooks/useJobs.ts` (custom hook)
- `ome-dashboard/src/components/ui/ProgressBar.tsx` (use from Task 2)

## Dependencies

- [ ] Task 2: StatsCard, ProgressBar, StatusBadge, RefreshIndicator components
- [ ] Task 6: Mock API with job data (including progress updates)
- [ ] React Query for data fetching with 10s interval
- [ ] date-fns for timestamp formatting (already installed)

## Effort Estimate

- **Size:** M (Medium)
- **Hours:** 12-16 hours (2 days)
- **Parallel:** false (depends on Tasks 2 & 6)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Jobs page implemented and routing configured
- [ ] Summary cards display correct job counts
- [ ] Job list displays all required information
- [ ] Progress bars animate smoothly for running jobs
- [ ] Pulse animation works on running job badges
- [ ] Auto-refresh works every 10 seconds without flicker
- [ ] Job status transitions handled correctly
- [ ] Loading and error states handled
- [ ] No TypeScript errors or ESLint warnings
- [ ] Page is responsive on mobile, tablet, desktop
- [ ] Job updates visible within 10 seconds
